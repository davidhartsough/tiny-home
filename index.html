          <h1>Looking for Land to Host My Tiny Home</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          I'm looking for a friendly Boise homeowner interested in leasing a
          small section (200+ sq ft) of their property for my Tiny Home on
          Wheels (THOW). This could be a great way for you to earn passive
          income by maximizing the potential of your property.
        </p>
        <h3>What I'm Offering</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Site prep cost-sharing</strong>: I'll cover at least half
            (and likely more) of the utility hookup costs, depending on
            estimates and lease terms.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Rent</strong>: $2500&ndash;$4500/year paid upfront,
            depending on lease terms and proximity to central Boise.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Potential exchanges</strong>: I'm happy to assist with:
            pet/plant sitting, yard care, general labor, caretaking, property
            maintenance, and other neighborly favors.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Property Requirements</h2>
        <p>Here's a quick checklist to see if your property is a fit:</p>
        <h3>My Preference</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Location</strong>: Ideally within a &lt;5-mile radius of
          downtown Boise ("biking distance").
        </p>
        <h3>Boise Code</h3>
        <h4><strong>Zones</strong>:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>All residential zones: R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, R-2, R-3</li>
          <li>Mixed zones: MX-1, MX-2, MX-3, and MX-H</li>
          <li>Open land: A-1 and A-2</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Pad Site</strong>:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Utilities</strong>: permanent electrical, sewer, and water
            hookups from your main house connections. (With permits,
            inspections, distance, and other factors, the cost can vary widely,
            but a broad estimate is roughly ~$5000&ndash;$18000.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Location</strong>: Must be ≥6 ft from other structures and
            behind the front plane of your house.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Shared Arrangements</h2>
        <p>What I'm hoping to share with you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Internet</strong>: I'd contribute to your internet bill and
            install a WiFi extender at or near the pad site. (Or we can explore
            installing a separate connection.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Laundry</strong>: Bi-weekly access to your washing machine
            and dryer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Outdoor space</strong>: I'd love to host outside and can buy
            outdoor furniture we could share.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Parking</strong>: A spot for my plug-in hybrid car near a
            120-volt outlet for charging.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mail</strong>: Permission to receive mail and packages at
            your address.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>
          I'm David (31), your friendly neighborhood conversationalist,
          psychologist, philosopher, creator, developer, and happy human.
          <br />
          I'm looking for a landowner who could become a great lifelong friend.
          <br />
          It's not often that you get to pick your neighbors, but in this
          scenario, we do!
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy to provide references if needed. (I'm sure we share a mutual
          friend or two here in Boise!)
        </p>
